Fax for you.
Thanks.
Don't go, Dawn.
Pull up a chair.
I was going to call you in. I need a quick word.
As you are aware, there are going to be redundancies.
You've made my life easier inasmuch as I'm going to let you go first.
What? Why? Why? 
Stealing. Thieving.
Thieving? What am I meant to have stolen? 
Post-It notes.
Post-It notes? What are they worth, about 12p?
You steal a thousand Post-It notes at 12p, you've made... a profit.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
I can't... God, I've never stolen as much as a paper clip and you're firing me.
And I don't need to give you severance pay because it's gross misconduct.
So you can go straight away.
Oh, now... 
That was a joke there. It was a joke we were doing.
You wanker.
Come on.
You're such a sad little man.
Am I? Didn't know that.
