You got a fax.
Oh, thank you.
Pam, Pam? Can you come in here for a sec? 
Just have a seat.
I was gonna call you in anyway. 
As you know, there is going to be downsizing 
You have made my life so much easier, in that I'm going to have to let you go first.
What? Why? Why?
Well, theft, and stealing.
Stealing? What am I suppose to have stolen?
Post-It notes. 
Post-It notes? What are those worth, like 50 cents?
You steal a thousand Post-It notes at 50 cents a piece, then you know you've made... a profit margin.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
I can't believe this. I mean, I have never even stolen as much as a paper clip and you're firing me.
And the best thing about it is that we are not gonna have to give you any severance pay, because that is gross misconduct. 
Just clean out your desk. 
I'm sorry.
Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around, you see? 
You're a jerk.
Well, I don't know about that.
